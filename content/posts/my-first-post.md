## Introduction

Hello my name is Jarod and I have an English degree and I am at the tail end of a Computer Science degree. I have a passion for reading and writing in both code and the English language. I believe that this sets me apart from most as I can act as a bridge between pure technicalities and communicative aspects, while fully understanding the nuance that each brings to the table.

As you get to know me through visiting my site and potentially talking to me you will come to find out I am a problem solver above all else. I value critical thinking and research where applicable. I love learning new things and I believe that anyone can learn anything as long as they put their mind to it.

When I put my mind to something I will not stop until I have solved or left that thing better than it was. I value innovation and the evermoving change forward to a brighter future. I acknowledge that every part to a bigger picture is necessary to get the job done.

With all this said I hope you enjoy my blog and reach out to me through LinkedIn or Email. Thanks for reading!

Best regards, Jarod
